Secured and monitored web infrastructure

This infrastructure secures and monitors a distributed web system.
HTTPS ensures encrypted traffic.
* A firewall protects the load balancer (HAProxy), which distributes requests to two backend servers.
* Each server runs Nginx, app code, MySQL (Primary or Replica), and a monitoring agent.
* A centralized monitoring tool collects logs and metrics.

Specifics About This Infrastructure
🔹 For every additional element, why you are adding it
Firewall:
 Protects each server by filtering incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.


HTTPS (SSL):
 Encrypts data between the user's browser and the server to ensure privacy and prevent interception.


Monitoring Agents:
 Installed on each server to collect system metrics, logs, and performance data.


Monitoring Collector:
 Central server (e.g., SumoLogic or Datadog) that receives and displays data from the agents for analysis.


🔹 What are firewalls for
* To block unauthorized access.
* To allow only specific traffic (e.g., port 80/443 for web, 22 for SSH).
* To reduce the attack surface of the system.

🔹 Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
* To encrypt communication between client and server.
* To protect sensitive data (like login credentials or personal info).
* To prevent MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks and data leaks.
* To improve SEO and browser compatibility, as most modern browsers require HTTPS.

🔹 What monitoring is used for
* To detect issues in real time (downtime, CPU overload, memory spikes).
* To track performance, availability, and usage metrics.
* To trigger alerts when thresholds are breached.
* To assist in debugging and post-incident analysis.

🔹 How the monitoring tool is collecting data
Monitoring agents run on each server and:

* Collect logs (e.g., Nginx access logs, syslogs).
* Gather metrics (CPU, memory, disk, uptime, etc.).
* Send this data to the central Monitoring Collector via secure channels.

🔹 Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS (Queries Per Second)
Configure your monitoring agent to read from:


* Nginx access logs, or
* HAProxy statistics endpoint
* Parse log lines or request counters to calculate:
* Number of HTTP requests per second
* Visualize this data in the monitoring dashboard (e.g., Datadog, Prometheus + Grafana).
